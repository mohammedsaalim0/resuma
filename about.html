        Hi, I’m Mohammed Saalim 👋✨ A passionate B.Tech Computer Science student from SSIT Tumkur,
        proudly hustling my way from a Tier-3 college while dreaming big to become a successful software engineer at top companies like Microsoft 💻🚀.
        My GPA is around 7.07, but I’m working hard every day to boost it 📚🔥. I have strong interest in Web Development and I’m currently doing an internship with InternPay 🧑‍💻.
        I’ve already built a couple of websites and also have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and strong command in C++. I’m learning DSA and taking steps towards becoming a full stack developer,
        planning to master MERN and backend using Python 🐍🌐. I even want to jump into AI/ML in the future 🤖💡. I enjoy improving my English through communication and writing with ChatGPT every day 📘🗣️. Apart from academics, I love Formula 1 (especially Max Verstappen 🏎️🔥) and I play Valorant where my current rank is Bronze 1, aiming for Silver soon 🎯⚔️. I believe in improving myself—whether it’s health, studies, coding, resume building or LinkedIn presence 💪💼.
        I have the mindset to grow, the fire to work harder, and I’m determined to turn my dreams into reality one step at a time 🚀🌟.
